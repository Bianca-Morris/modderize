# Modderize

## Introduction

This project was created from the official [Next.js TailwindCSS template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss) using `npx create-next-app --example with-tailwindcss with-tailwindcss-app`.

## Set Up

### Basic Installation
1. Clone this repo locally
2. `npm install` dependencies
3. `npm run dev` will start the dev-server (Note: you'll need to set up env variables in the next step for the app to work!)

### Setting up environment variables
1. Set up a Google Firebase account and project (with Authentication and Firestore)
2. Create a copy of `.env.local-template` at the root of this repo; name it `.env.local` or `.env.sh`
3. Enter the keys from your Firebase project into this file; save it.
4. Use terminal to `source <your env file>`
